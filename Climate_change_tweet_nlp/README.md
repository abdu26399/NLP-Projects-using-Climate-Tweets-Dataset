# Nlp project on climate change tweet types

This is a project based on the believe of climate change tweet type 
based on the kaggle dataset:
 https://www.kaggle.com/code/roellekim/twitter-climate-change-sentiment-analysis

 We carried out the performance on three different models by hugging face
 1) the bert uncased
 2) The roberta model 
 3) Text to text google/Flant t5
 We also did hyperparemeter tuning to figure out the features that tweek the hyperparameters
 Below the result form the hyper paramertune and interesting outcome from flant t-5 is sown when being run against three runs:
